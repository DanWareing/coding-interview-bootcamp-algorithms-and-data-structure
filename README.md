#### [1] Reverse String
  Given a string, return it reversed
###### Learnings:
  Whilst String has no 'reverse' function, arrays do
  Arrays can be re-combined using 'join'
  'Reduce' will execute a provided function on each member of an array, outputting a single value

#### [2] Palindrome
  Given a string, return true if it is the same value when reversed
###### Learnings:
  N/a

#### [3] Reverse Integer
  Given an integer, return it reversed (with the same positive/ negative sign)
###### Learnings:
  'Math.sign' will return -1 or 1 based on whether the given integer is positive or negative
  Javascript has the expected 'parseInt' and 'toString' functions

#### [4] Max Char
  Given a string, create a character map and return the most-frequently used character
###### Learnings:
  'for' loops on arrays, 'in' loops on objects
  You can use the OR (||) operator to catch 'false' assignments, such as in "chars[char] = chars[char]+1 || 1;"

#### [5] FizzBuzz
  Given an integer, count up to it and print each number, unless it's divisible by three and/ or five
###### Learnings:
  N/a
